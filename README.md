## 👋 Hi, I'm Mikolaj

### 🎓 A high school student learning C++

I'm currently exploring C++ and working on fun side projects.

One of my recent projects is **[GitForest](https://github.com/tmikolaj/GitForest)** — where the more you code, the more your forest grows!  
🌲 25 commits = a spruce tree  
🌸 10 pull requests = a cherry blossom tree
