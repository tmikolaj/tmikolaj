## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mikolaj

### ðŸŽ“ A high school student learning C++

I'm currently diving into graphics programming

#### One of my recent projects are

**[ende](https://github.com/tmikolaj/ende)** - that lets you generate procedural stuff (for now terrain and rocks)
 **[GitForest](https://github.com/tmikolaj/GitForest)** â€” where the more you code, the more your forest grows!

**[ASCIIFrame](https://github.com/tmikolaj/ASCIIFrame)** - where you can make ASCII animations
